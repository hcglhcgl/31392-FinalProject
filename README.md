# 31392-FinalProject

You are provided with: 
• Two datasets that contain: 
    o Raw stereo pair images (uncalibrated, unrectified) of objects on a conveyor. 
    o Raw stereo pair images (uncalibrated, unrectified) of objects on a conveyor with occlusion. Both datasets include multiple images of objects as they travel on the conveyor. The datasets contain images of 3 objects classes (cups, books and boxes). 
• Calibration pattern images for the used stereo camera camera.

Project Goals 
• Calibrate and rectify the stereo input. 
• Process the input images to detect objects on the conveyor and track them in 3D, even under occlusions. 
• Train a machine learning system that can classify unseen images into the 3 classes (cups, books and boxes) based either on 2D or 3D data. 
    o Use the web or/and capture your own images to create your training set. The image datasets provided with the project will constitute your testing set.git
